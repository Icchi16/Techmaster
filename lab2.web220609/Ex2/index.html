      <p>
        Once you reserve a campaign through reach and frequency buying, your CPM
        is fixed, and you'll only pay the price that you established for your
        campaign.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your ad set delivers more than 100% of booked impressions, we will
        not charge you more than the budget you've set.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many factors that go into determining a campaign's fixed CPM.
        These factors are the same whether you're buying ads in the auction or
        reserving campaigns in advance through reach and frequency buying.
      </p>
      <p>Factors that may determine your CPM include, but aren't limited to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Target audience</li>
        <li>
          Schedule of dates for the campaign – when your ads are scheduled to
          run e.g. Campaigns that run during a holiday or a major sporting event
          may cost more than campaigns that run during lower-traffic times of
          the year.
        </li>
        <li>
          Placements (Facebook or Instagram) – where your ads appear e.g. If
          your ads appear on Instagram only or on both Instagram and Facebook.
        </li>
        <li>
          Frequency cap – the maximum number of times someone will be shown your
          ads.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creative type – the creative format of your ad determines where it can
          be placed and how it will be received. e.g. Canvas ads can only be
          delivered on mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          Objective and optimisation – if you choose to optimise for video
          views. <br />
          Bear in mind that reach and frequency buying optimises primarily for
          reach and secondarily for your chosen objective
        </li>
        <li>
          Budget – the maximum amount that you're willing to spend on a
          campaign.
        </li>
        <li>
          Market demand – the market demand for your target audience at the time
          when your campaign is reserved.
        </li>
        <li>
          Market supply – how available and responsive your target audience is
          on Facebook and Instagram.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your own overlapping campaigns – if you're running multiple campaigns
          at the same time that target the same audience, it can drive up the
          cost of that audience.
        </li>
        <li>
          Creative quality and relevance – negative or positive feedback that
          your ads received in the last 90 days. <br />

      <p>
        Reach and frequency buying offers highly predictable delivery of reach
        and impressions, but it's not a 100% guarantee of either.
